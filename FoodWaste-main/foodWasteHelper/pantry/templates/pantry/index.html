  <h1>Welcome to your Food Waste Helper!</h1>

  <p>"In the United States, food waste is estimated at 
  between 30–40 percent of the food supply. This figure, based on 
  estimates from USDA’s Economic Research Service of 31 percent 
  food loss at the retail and consumer levels, corresponded to 
  approximately 133 billion pounds and $161 billion worth of food
  in 2010. Wasted food is the single largest category of material 
  placed in municipal landfills and represents nourishment 
  that could have helped feed families in need." <br> -U.S. Food
  & Drug Administration</p>
  <p>Consumers can help reduce their food waste by keeping their
  food organized and making sure to eat foods before they expire.
  The Food Waste Helper can help you and your family reduce food
  waste by keeping track of all of your foods and their 
  expiration dates.
